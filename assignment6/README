Assignment 6 shows the differential cross section of weak processes when using POWHEG (NLO processes)
macro1 considers just the pt cross section of NLO
macro2 considers the pt cross section from both NLO and LO and compares the two
macro3 adds the background processes to the NLO pt cross section
macro4 adds the background processes to the NLO rapidity cross section
