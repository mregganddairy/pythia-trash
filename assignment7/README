*Slaps roof of code* 
This bad boy showers all the powheg lhe files and plots them all in rapidity and pt.

assignment7.cc and assignment7.cmnd work together to shower POWHEG files. however they should be run using theshowerer.cc.
bash theshowerer.sh to shower everything in rawPWHG
root assignment7macro.cc to get the pt plots for all showered files
root assignment7macro2.cc to get the rapidity plots for all showered files.
root assignment7macro3.cc to compare different pdfs...
root assignment7macro4.cc to produce differential cross section for y incorporating pdfs' corresponding uncertainty. Also produces uncertainty percentage plots and the ratios of the electroweak bosons. 

root assignment8macro(1-3).cc uhm I forgor
root assignment8macro4.cc plots the rapidity differential cross section for all bosons and also provides the ratios of different pdfs and their uncertainties.
root assignment8macro5.cc plots the invariant mass differential cross section for JUST Z BOSON and also provides the ratios of different pdfs and their uncertainties.
root assignment8macro6.cc plots the transverse momentum of the diffferential cross section and also provides the ratios of theratios of different podfs and their uncertainties.
the _1.cc files are made specifically for determining the ratios (Apm, Rpm and RZ/W) ratios for their corresponding distributions.


plotPDFs.cc... plots PDFs for hessian type PDFs.
plotPDFs_NNN.cc is the successful version plotPDFs_NN.cc and plots the pdfs for neural network type pdfs.
