Dis da code I used for ma masters in pp collisions. Mostly uses pythia, root and powheg.

Assignment1:erm...

Assignment2:what the sigma?

Assignment3:first implementation of soft qcd and hard qcd into a single script.

Assignment4: using binning method to reach higher pt values and looking atthe contributions from different backgrounds (i.e. muons not coming from W and Z).

Assignment5: attempt at implementation of electroweak effects inorder to calculate contributions from W and Z to the muon distribution in LO using standalone pythia.

Assignment6: Using POWHEG .lhe files to calculate contributions from W and Z to the muon distribution in NLO.
